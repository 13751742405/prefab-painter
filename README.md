# Free Prefab Painter
A free, basic prefab-painter for Unity3D.

# Usage

Import the project into Unity3D and open the prefab brush tool by clicking Tools -> Prefab Brush.

## Painting

> ctrl + left mouse button to paint

> ctrl + scroll to change the brush size

## Palettes

Palettes function like 'painting presets'. You could for example create a 'Forest Palette' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can import/export these palettes into the prefab brush.
