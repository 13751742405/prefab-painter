# Free Prefab Painter
A free, basic prefab-painter for Unity3D.

# Usage

## Palettes

Palettes are 'painting presets'. You can for example create a 'Forest Palette' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can manage your palettes using the palette toolbar. You can use the 'Load' button to load a custom palette from your project folder, or you can create a new palette by clicking 'palettes>New Palette'. After you've edited a palette, don't forget to save it.
