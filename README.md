# Usage
After you've download the files somewhere, open up the package manager in your Unity project and locate the package.json. This will import the tool as a Unity package. You can also just put all of files in your Unity project if you'd like to. 

# Features
- Paint on every type of surface (plane, terrain, sphere,...)
- Paint multiple types of prefabs at once
- Paint with random prefab rotations
- Paint with random prefab sizes
- Prefab previewer
- Customizable brush size, density
- Paint on selected layers
- Palette/presets functionality with useful toolbar

## Painting

> ctrl + left mouse button to paint

> ctrl + scroll to change the brush size

> alt + scroll to change the brush density

## Palettes
Palettes are 'painting presets'. You can for example create a 'Forest Palette' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can manage your palettes using the palette toolbar. You can use the 'Load' button to load a custom palette from your project folder, or you can create a new palette by clicking 'palettes>New Palette'. After you've edited a palette, don't forget to save it.

# Compatibility
This tool has been tested with Unity 2018.3.0f2.
