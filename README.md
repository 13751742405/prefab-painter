# Free Prefab Painter
A free, basic prefab-painter for Unity3D.

# Usage

Import the project into Unity3D and open the prefab brush tool by clicking Tools -> Prefab Brush.

## Painting

> ctrl + left mouse button to paint

> ctrl + scroll to change the brush size

## Palettes

Palettes function like 'painting presets'. You could for example create a 'Forest Palette' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can import/export these palettes into the prefab brush.

# Future Features
I (Alexander Ameye) am not actively working on this tool but when I do get the time to work on this project, these are the features I would like to add.

- Align objects along normals
- 'Painting rules' like 'don't paint on surfaces that have a slope that is > 10%'
- Cleaner UI
- Undo/redo support
