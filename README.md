# Free Prefab Painter
A free, basic prefab-painter for Unity3D.

# Usage

Import the project into Unity3D and open the prefab brush tool by clicking Tools -> Prefab Brush.

## Painting

> ctrl + left mouse button to paint

> ctrl + scroll to change the brush size

> alt + scroll to change the brush density


## Palettes

Palettes function like 'painting presets'. You could for example create a 'Forest Palette' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can import/export these palettes into the prefab brush.

> Right Mouse Click in Project window -> Prefab Painter -> Create Palette

> In Prefab Painter window select palette and click "Import"

# Compatibility

# Future Updates
I (Alexander Ameye) am not actively working on this tool but when I do get the time to work on this project, these are the features I would like to add.

- Align along surface normal
- Slope painting rules
- New UI
- Undo/redo support
- Rewrite UI in UIElements
- 'Erase'brush
- 'Grid' brush
- Run-time prefab placing mode
- Maybe instead of an editor window, have the painter as a 'brush gameobject' with the settings in the inspector. This way you don't need another editor window taking up space.
- Add images to the read-me
